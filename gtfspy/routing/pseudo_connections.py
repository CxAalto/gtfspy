def compute_pseudo_connections(
    transit_connections, start_time_dep, end_time_dep, transfer_margin, walk_network, walk_speed
):
    """
    Given a set of transit events and the static walk network,
    "transform" the static walking network into a set of "pseudo-connections".

    As a first approximation, we add pseudo-connections to depart after each arrival of a transit connection
    to it's arrival stop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transit_connections: list[Connection]
    start_time_dep : int
        start time in unixtime seconds
    end_time_dep: int
        end time in unixtime seconds (no new connections will be scanned after this time)
    transfer_margin: int
        required extra margin required for transfers in seconds
    walk_speed: float
        walking speed between stops in meters / second
    walk_network: networkx.Graph
        each edge should have the walking distance as a data attribute ("d_walk") expressed in meters
