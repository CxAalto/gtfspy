"""Shape tools

This module contains tools for dealing with shapes.

The core data structure for representing shapes is
[ {'seq':N, 'lat':F, 'lon':F}, ... ].
`seq` is the integer index of sequence points (note that GTFS doesn't
require integers), and lat/lon are latitude/longitude.  Note that
there is no stop_id or other data stored, though any other data can be
put in the dictionary and it will be preserved.  The 'd' key, if
present, represents cumulative distance (m) along the points.

This same structure is used for representing sequences of stops.  The
function `find_segments` take a shape-sequence and stop-sequence, and
returns a list of `break_points`, which are the indexes within
shape-sequence which correspond to each stop within stop-sequence.

You can then pass `break_points` and the shape-sequence to the
function `return_segments`, which returns a list
[ [ shape-sequence ],
  [ shape-sequence ],
  ...,
  [ ]
]
This is the shape, broken down into individual segments, one
corresponding to each stop.  The last one is empty.
